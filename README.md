# Convert_Log_Private
A Python code to extract the final geometry from Gaussian Output files (.log) and convert them to Gaussian Input files (.com) with new keywords for quick submission.  Keywords must be edited to fit your own personal needs. (Eg. solvent, calculation types, basis sets etc.) Thus it should be used as a scaffold.
