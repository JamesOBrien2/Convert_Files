# convert_log
A Python script to extract the final geometry from Gaussian Output files (.log) and convert them to Gaussian Input files (.com) with new keywords for quick submission.

Keywords must be edited to fit your own personal needs. (Eg. solvent, calculation types, basis sets etc.) Thus it should be used as a scaffold.

# convert_sp
A Python script to easily produce input files for Atoms-In-Molecules (AIM), Non-Bonding Orbitals (NBO), and Molecular Electrostatic Potential (MEP) calculations.
